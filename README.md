# ShutUpAndType

üé§ A lightweight Windows voice recording application with automatic speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI Whisper API.

## Features

‚úÖ **Global hotkey** - Record using Scroll Lock from any application
‚úÖ **Real-time transcription** - Automatic speech recognition via OpenAI Whisper
‚úÖ **Smart text input** - Types transcribed text directly into any focused application
‚úÖ **Always on top** - Stays visible while working
‚úÖ **Low resource usage** - Records in low-quality mono WAV (8kHz, 8-bit)
‚úÖ **Auto cleanup** - Deletes audio files after transcription
‚úÖ **Smart config** - Finds configuration files like npm (searches up directory tree)

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release or build from source
2. **Configure API key** - Create `config.json` (see Configuration section)
3. **Run** the application
4. **Record** - Press `Scroll Lock` to start/stop recording
5. **Type** - Transcribed text automatically appears in your focused application

## Configuration

The application searches for `config.json` in this order:
1. `%APPDATA%\ShutUpAndType\config.json` (recommended)
2. Next to the executable file
3. Current directory and up to 5 parent directories (npm-style resolution)

### Example config.json:
```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "sk-your-openai-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Press Scroll Lock** ‚Üí Starts recording from default microphone
2. **Press Scroll Lock again** ‚Üí Stops recording and uploads to OpenAI Whisper
3. **Text appears** ‚Üí Transcribed text is automatically typed via clipboard (preserves original clipboard)
4. **File cleanup** ‚Üí Temporary audio file is deleted
